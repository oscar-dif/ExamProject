Main goals:
- forecasting house price using ML.
- build vizualizations tools to draw insights.

Good to have:
- ML cluster analysis (identify group of properties that perform similarly).
- explain price variation.
- database modeling.
- create a database.
- flask application.

Relevance:
A successful data-driven approach can help provide powerful insights. Our machine learning model can help 
real estate agents correctly estimate sale price of houses for their customers. 

Dataset:
80 attributes
1460 entries

Machine learning
1. Preprocessing
1.1. Load data - pandas read_csv and define X and y
1.2. Make lables for classes (strings) - sklearn.preprocessing LabelEncoder
1.3. Standardize numeric data - sklearn.preprocessing StandardScaler
1.4. Split the data into train and test sets - sklearn.model_selection train_test_split

2. Create  and apply regression model
2.1. Create objects of an algorithm to store the models: linear, SVM, NN, random forest
2.2. Fit/train the model with your training set
2.3. Predict and analyze the results in the test set
2.4. Compare and select the best model
